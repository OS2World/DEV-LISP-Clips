********************
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
********************

Garbage partial matches generated by object pattern matching
were not garbage collected until a run command was issued.
This would cause increasing memory usage under situations 
where activations were added and removed from the agenda,
but rules were never fired.

*****************
COMMAND SEQUENCE:
*****************

***********
RESOLUTION:
***********

In the file OBJRTMCH.C, add 

   #include "engine.h"

after

   #include "drive.h"

In the file OBJRTMCH.C, add the following code at the bottom
of the ObjectNetworkAction function:

   /*=========================================*/
   /* Free partial matches that were released */
   /* by the assertion of the fact.           */
   /*=========================================*/

   if (ExecutingRule == NULL) FlushGarbagePartialMatches();
